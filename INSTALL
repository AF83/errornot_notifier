=== Configuration

You should have something like this in config/initializers/errornot.rb.

  ErrornotNotifier.configure do |config|
    config.api_key = '1234567890abcdef'
  end

(Please note that this configuration should be in a global configuration, and
is *not* environment-specific. Errornot is smart enough to know what errors are
caused by what environments, so your staging errors don't get mixed in with
your production errors.)

You can test that Errornot is working in your production environment by using
this rake task (from RAILS_ROOT):

  rake errornot:test

If everything is configured properly, that task will send a notice to Errornot
which will be visible immediately.

NOTE FOR RAILS 1.2.* USERS:

You will need to copy the errornot_notifier_tasks.rake file into your
RAILS_ROOT/lib/tasks directory in order for the rake errornot:test task to work.
